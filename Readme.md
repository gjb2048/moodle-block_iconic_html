Installation
============
 1. Ensure you have the version of Moodle as stated above in 'Required version of Moodle'.  This is essential as the
    block relies on underlying core code that is out of my control.
 2. Login as an administrator and put Moodle in 'Maintenance Mode' so that there are no users using it bar you as the administrator.
 3. Copy the extracted 'iconic_html' folder to the '/blocks/' folder.
 4. Go to 'Site administration' -> 'Notifications' and follow standard the 'plugin' update notification.
 5. Put Moodle out of Maintenance Mode.

Upgrading
=========
 1. Ensure you have the version of Moodle as stated above in 'Required version of Moodle'.  This is essential as the
    block relies on underlying core code that is out of my control.
 2. Login as an administrator and put Moodle in 'Maintenance Mode' so that there are no users using it bar you as the administrator.
 3. Make a backup of your old 'iconic_html' folder in '/blocks/' and then delete the folder.
 4. Copy the replacement extracted 'iconic_html' folder to the '/blocks/' folder.
 5. Go to 'Site administration' -> 'Notifications' and follow standard the 'plugin' update notification.
 6. Put Moodle out of Maintenance Mode.

Uninstallation
==============
 1. Put Moodle in 'Maintenance Mode' so that there are no users using it bar you as the administrator.
 3. In '/blocks/' remove the folder 'iconic_html'.
 4. Put Moodle out of Maintenance Mode.

Reporting issues
================
Before reporting an issue, please ensure that you are running the latest version for your release of Moodle.  It is essential
that you are operating the required version of Moodle as stated at the top - this is because the block relies on core
functionality that is out of its control.

I operate a policy that I will fix all genuine issues for free.  Improvements are at my discretion.  I am happy to make bespoke
customisations / improvements for a negotiated fee. 

It is essential that you provide as much information as possible, the critical information being the contents of the blocks's 
'version.php' file.  Other version information such as specific Moodle version, theme name and version also helps.  A screen shot
can be really useful in visualising the issue along with any files you consider to be relevant.

Known issues
============
1. Does not work well with the Shoehorn or Essential themes.


Version information
